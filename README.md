# PyHD

Python library for Human Design – BodyGraph calculations and analysis.

PyHD computes complete Human Design charts from birth date and time. It calculates planetary
activations for both the Personality (birth) and Design (88° solar arc before birth) imprints, and
derives all characteristics.

This library uses (a [Python extension](https://github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph) to) the
[Swiss Ephemeris](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/) for high-precision planetary position
calculations.
